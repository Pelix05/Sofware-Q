This unified diff patch fixes the issues reported by the static analysis tool by moving the assignment of `x_diff` and `y_diff` inside the `if` statement that checks for their values. This ensures that they are not possibly used before assignment. The patch is syntactically correct and should be compatible with `git apply`.
