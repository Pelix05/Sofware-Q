- The patch adds a line to calculate `x_diff` and `y_diff` correctly, avoiding the `E0606` warnings for possibly used variables before assignment.
- It places the calculation inside the `if` block for "top" and "bottom" sides, ensuring they are assigned before being used in the loop.
- The patch modifies one line (`x_diff, y_diff = ...`) and is syntactically correct.
